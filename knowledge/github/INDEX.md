# GitHub Knowledge Index

## Purpose
Working knowledge and operational playbooks for GitHub across day-to-day development workflows.

## Start Here
1. Read `CONCEPTS.md` for core mental models
2. Use `PLAYBOOKS.md` for repeatable workflows
3. Copy from `COMMANDS.md` for terminal actions
4. Check `FAQ.md` for common issues
5. Review `SOURCES.md` for canonical docs

## Maintenance
- Add new procedures when repeated twice
- Keep command snippets tested and current
- Link every major claim to a source in `SOURCES.md`
